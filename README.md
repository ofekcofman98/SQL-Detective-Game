**SQL Detective**

SQL Detective is a cross-platform detective investigation game where players solve cases using SQL queries.
The game is built in Unity (PC + Mobile) and communicates with a custom .NET backend and Supabase PostgreSQL database.

**🎮 Game Overview**

* PC: the main investigation platform (exploration, dialogue, story progression).

* Mobile: becomes an interactive SQL controller using a visual drag-and-drop Query Builder.

* Players progress through missions, uncover clues, and unlock new database tables as they solve each step of the case.
